<h1> Use of A.I in Coding </h1>
<p> 
  During my fall 2023 semester, our ICS 314 class was given the choice to use A.I in a variety of different ways. During this semester, I experienced using a few A.I tools for 
the first time, such as Github Copilot and ChatGPT. I found these tools to be extremely useful at times, but they were not a solution for every problem I came across.

<h3> WODS </h3>
<p> During the semester we had "WODS", which were assignments to help us apply techniques we learned throughout the semester. Experience Wods were 
  homework assignments to get familiar with new techniques, in-class practice WODs prepared us for upcomming quizes, and in-class WODs were the quizes given every week
to test our abilities to use what we learned. When I first heard that we were allowed to use the A.I during all of our work, I felt hesitant, as I thought that by using A.I
  I would not be learning anything, and simply copying and pasting code. I decided that throughout the semester, I would avoid using tools like ChatGPT to solve problems in the homework assignments. When completing the in class practice and quiz WODS, I found that GitHub Copilot was extremely helpful when I had to write repetitive code and imports. It was also very useful for corecting mistakes in my code. Since our WOD quizzes were times, using ChatGPT to find and explain errors in my code saved me a lot of time. ChatGPT provides good explanations for mistakes and explained how to correct them well. However, ChatGPT could not solve every problem that I came across. For these tools to be useful, I believe that you would need to have some basic knowledge of what you are working with, but is very useful for using new tools.
