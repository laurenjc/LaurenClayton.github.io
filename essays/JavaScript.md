Learning a new programming language will always feel like a daunting task for me. It is like starting at ground zero. While I have tools under my belt, no language is the same. Despite this, I found that learning JavaScript didn’t feel the same way. While using the skills I learned from learning Java, C and C++, the learning experience has felt more like review, practice and adding on to my “toolset” of languages. Comparing them all, I think that along with Java, JavaScript is one of my favorite programming languages. The syntax feels straightforward, and with my previous knowledge of Java and C completing the basics on freecodecamp.com was not a difficult task.


Personally, I believe that JavaScript is a good programming language. Although there is a reason that there are situations where JavaScript isn’t the optimal programming language, the flexibility that comes with it makes it a good programming language. Like Java, it is also an easy language to learn, compared to C/C++. This simplicity made it easy to complete a lot of homework assignments and practice WODs given in class. 


The WODs we create in class are good to practice the work we have done in class, or what we have studied the past week. However, I felt that despite doing all of the practice WODs, I still needed more practice outside of what was given by the teachers and TAs. I think that with more practice, I can become faster and more efficient in doing the WODS and improve my coding skills. A big problem I have with coding is that I often make many syntax errors, and it takes me a lot of time to go back and debug my code. With the WODs, I have less time to work on this, and it pushes me to create accurate code from the start. I am not sure if this style will work for me or not, but I think that with more practice I will get better at them.

From the first week of class, I can say that I have enjoyed using JavaScript and the ways we have studied. Though fast-paced, I feel that my previous computer science courses have accurately prepared me for the 300+ level classes that I am now taking. The most difficult part has been accurately completing the WODs and keeping up with the class. With time and effort, I believe that I will be able to get better at problem solving and code more accurately through the WODs and projects given to us in class.
