	Before getting into using Bootstrap, I assumed it would be extremely simple compared to coding in pure HTML. In reality, I felt like there was a huge learning curve, but the more I used it, the more I realized how simple and easy it was to develop a homepage.

	For our first practice WOD, we were tasked to create a simple webpage with information about surfers. We werenâ€™t given much instruction about choosing pictures, colors, fonts, and spacing, I realized how not only information, but aesthetics are also very important. Another problem that arose when using Bootstrap was the number of options there were, and how hard it was to memorize. Although it is extremely simple, it took a long time for me to learn how to use it. At times, I felt like Bootstrap had almost too many ways of customization, and I preferred to use CSS by itself.

	However, I think that using Bootstrap is much quicker and more efficient when wanting to create simple. Given the extensive documentation and examples given in Bootstrap, the learning curve is definitely worth learning. Besides making it simple to create colors, navigation bars the extensive list of icons, small adjustments such as manipulating margins and padding become a breeze. Despite the learning curve that may arise when using Bootstrap, the easy of use and resources will make it worth it in the end.
