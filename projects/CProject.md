This was the first computer science assignment given to me when learning C / C++. Though simple, it helped me get used to coding and taught me important differences between other programming languages such as Java. When first learning C/ C++, I found the differences between Java and C very daunting. Not only this but learning how to code in UNIX felt daunting as well. However, after the course, I feel that these skills are very important for me to keep practicing.
