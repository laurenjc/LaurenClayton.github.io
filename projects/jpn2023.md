During my summer, I decided to study abroad in Japan to improve my communication skills. For our final project, all students in our class were to make a video project documenting all their experiences they have made, new things they saw and what they learned during their time in Fukuoka, Japan. 

With this project I was able to practice my photography and work on my video editing skills. It had been around four years since I had been able to practice my photography and video editing skills from previous classes. I think this was a great experience for me to not only work on my language skills but also work on older skills I have not used in a while
