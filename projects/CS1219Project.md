My final project for my final class sequence for Java was to create a program that would be able to takes in the User's height weight and age to calculate BMR. It also takes in how many calories they ate in a day along with what food they ate. Then, it asks for the User's name and email, along with asking their email, validating if it is written correctly (using .com and @ symbol.). 

This was the first project coding project I have done. I was able to complete it using the skills I learned throughout the semester from individual and group projects. Though only given a short amount of time from being a summer course, I was able to learn how to effeciently and accurately code in a short amount of time. I also learned skills such as how to use regex and Swing in Java.
